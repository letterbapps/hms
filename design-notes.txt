Need margin in/out hubnote to reduce provider's moving out of hubnote (change sharding key value)
micro-service vs normal similar to asyn-js vs syn-js (observable pattern, parallel)
start up: create topic if not existing
setup producer, consumer.
hub service handler before provider service, then place result message
each service method is a kafka topic
